Since https://github.com/facebook/connect-js hasn't recieved a meaningfull update in months, even 
though facebook has pushed new JS to production nearly every week, this project aims to provide a 
useful resource to developers who are working with facebook's JS SDK and would like to see what has 
changed recently.

My server runs a nightly cronjob to download the latest file from 
http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js, de-minifies it, and push the changes to github.

Credit for the idea goes to Roger Hu - http://hustoknow.blogspot.com/

The JS is copyright Facebook, Inc. and, to the best of my knowledge, released under an Apache 2.0 License

This is obviously not endorsed or supported by Facebook - if it was, they'd probably update their 
own github account.
